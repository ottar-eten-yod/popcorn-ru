# Popcorn Time Ru API server

It is an API server, you don't need this to watch films on the client.<br>
Just download the client from project page (https://popcorn-time.ga/build/).
For english films you may simply put https://popcorn-time.ga/ as the Custom API Server in the advanced settings if you use the official Popcorn Time app (0.4.4+git).<br>
However, for films in other languages, you need the fork version of the client.

If you want to add some trackers or create a self-hosted server then you can fork it.

It is hosted in free tier google cloud - search is slow - no elastic and 580 mb ram.

No anime for at the moment, please extend the api if you know an api for anime like TMDB for films and shows.

## Deployment
It is a standard symfony v5 application that requires:<br>
`nginx, php-8.1, mariadb, cron, tor, elasticsearch, git, redis`<br>

It is highly recommended that you configure a nginx cache.
